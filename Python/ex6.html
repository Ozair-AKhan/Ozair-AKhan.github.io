        <h1>Strings and Text</h1>
    </div>
    <p>We will now type in a whole bunch of strings, variables, and formats, and print them. You will 
        also practice using short abbreviated variable names. Programmers love saving themselves time
        at your expense by using anoying cryptic variable names, so let's get you started being able to read 
        and write them early on.

<h2>STUDY DRILLS</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.</li>
    <li>Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places</li>
    <li>Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.</li>
    <li>Explain why addin gthe two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.</li>

<h1>Asking Questions</h1>
<p> What we want to do now is get data into your programs. This is a little tricky because you 
  have to do two things that may not make sense right away, but trust me and do it anyway. 
</p>
</div>
<p> Most of what software does is the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Take some kind of input from a person</li>
    <li>Change it</li>
    <li>Print out something to show how it changed</li>
  </ol></p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
<code>print "How old are you?"
age = raw_input()
print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()
print "How much do you weigh?",
weight = raw_input()

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
  age, height, weight)</code></pre>
<h2>Study Drills</h2>
<ul>
<li> Go online and find out what Python's raw_input does.</li>
<li> Can you find other ways to use it? Try some of the samples you find.</li>
<li> Write another "form" like this to ask some other questions</li>
<li> Related to escape sequences, try to find out why the last line has '6\ '2"' with that \' sequence 
  See how the single-quote needs to be escaped because otherwise it would end the string?
</li>
</ul>

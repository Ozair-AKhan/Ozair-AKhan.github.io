<h1>Numbers and Math</h1>
<p>This exercise has lots of math symbols. Let's name them right away so you know what they are called. 
    As you type this one in, say the names. When saying them feels boring, you can stop saying them.</p>
</div>
<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums"><code>
print "I will now count my chickens:"

print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4 
        
print "Now I will count the eggs:"
        
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
        
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
        
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
        
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
        
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7
        
print "Oh, that's why it's False."
        
print "How about some more."
        
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2

<h2>STUDY DRILLS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.</li> 
<li>Remember in Exercise 0 when you started Python? Start Python this way again and, using the above 
    characters and what you know, use Python as a calculator.</li>
<li>Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.</li>
<li>Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why 
    by researching what a "floating point" number is. Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers 
    so it's more accurate(hint:20.0 is floating point)</li>
</ol>

<h1>Prompting People</h1>
<p>For raw_input, you can also put in a prompt to show to a person so he knows what to type.
    Put a string that you want for the prompt inside the (). This prompts the user with "Name?"
    and puts the result into the variable y. This is how you ask someone question and get the 
    answer. 
    This means we can completely rewrite our previous exercise using just raw_input to do all the 
    prompting. 
</p>
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
<code>age = raw_input("How old are you? ")
      height = raw_input("How tall are you? ")
      weight = raw_input("How much do you weigh? ")

      print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
          age, height, weight
      )
</code></pre>
</div>
<h1>STUDY DRILLS</h1>
<ol>
    <li> In terminal, where you normally run python to run your scripts, type pydoc raw_input. 
         Read what it says. If you're on Windows try python -m pydoc raw_input instead.
    </li>
    <li> Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit.</li>
    <li> Look online for what the pydoc command does.</li>
    <li> Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. It's alright if you do not understand those;
        Just read through and take notes about interesting thngs. 
    </li>
</ol>

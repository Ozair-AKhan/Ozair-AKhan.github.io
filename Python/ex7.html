    </div>
    <p>Now we are going to do a bunch of exercises where you just type code in and make it run. I 
        won't be explaining much since it is just more of the same. The purpose is to build up your 
        chops. See you in a few exercises much, and <i>do not skip! Do not paste</i>
    </p>
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
<code>print "Mary had a little lamb."
print "Its fleece was white as %s" % 'snow'
print "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "." * 10 # what'd that do

<h2>STUDY DRILLS</h2>
<p>For these next few exercises, you will have the exact same Study Drills.</p>
</div>
<ol>
    <li>Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.</li>
    <li>Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.</li>
    <li>From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper 
        what kind of mistake you made. 
    </li>When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made 
    and try not to make in this new one. 
    <li>Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who like everyone 
        to think they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
